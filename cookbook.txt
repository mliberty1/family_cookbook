  Preheat oven on bake to 425°.
  Split loaf French bread in half.
  Spread butter (or margarine if desired) liberally on the faces of the loaves.
  Sprinkle the buttered faces with garlic salt to taste (i.e., to your level of garlic tolerance).
  Break the slices of American cheese into sections about 1/3 inch wide and lay them out on the faces of the loaf with about 1/3" between pieces of cheese.
  Sprinkle the Mozzarella on top the American cheese slices.  Again, there is no guide to how much or little cheese.  Just remember that too much cheese will make it difficult to melt the cheese and keep the bread shell soft enough to eat.
  Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on the Mozzarella to taste.
  Sprinkle oregano and thyme spices on the cheese to taste. You can also substitute Italian Spice.  Add an additional sprinkling of garlic salt if you haven't poisoned yourself yet.
  Sprinkle parsley flakes on the bread for a touch of additional color.
  Bake at 425° until the cheese is fully melted, or just a few VERY small spots of browned cheese are appearing on the edges of the bread.
  Cut into strips and serve hot.

FILENAME = 00000017.html
PREP = 45

[Ingredients.00000000]
  2 cups all-purpose flour
  2 teaspoons baking powder
  1/2 teaspoon baking soda
  1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
  1/2 teaspoon salt
  8 Tablespoons (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut up
  1 cup raisins
  2 Tablespoons granulated sugar
  1 large egg (separate yolk and white)
  3/4 cup buttermilk or plain yogurt
  1 Additional sugar for sprinkling
[Instructions.00000000]
  Preheat oven to 375°.
  Put flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, and salt into a large bowl; stir to mix well.
  Add butter and cut in with a pastry blender or rub in with your fingers, until the mixture looks like fine granules.
  Add raisins and sugar;  toss to distribute evenly.
  Add egg yolk to buttermilk in a measuring cup and whisk with a fork to blend.
  Pour over the flour mixture and stir wit a fork until a soft dough forms.
  Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and give 10 to 12 kneads.
  Cut dough in half.  Knead each half briefly into a ball; turn smooth side up and pat into a 6" circle.  Cut into 6 wedges, but do not separate wedges.
  In a small bowl, beat the egg white with a fork until just broken up.  Brush the top of each scone with egg white and sprinkle lightly with sugar.
  With a pancake turner, carefully transfer the two cut circles to an ungreased cookie sheet.  IF necessary reshape circles so that the 6 wedges in each are touching.  This will keep the raisins from burning
  Bake 18 to 22 minutes, until medium brown.  Cool on a wire rack; after 5 minutes pull the wedges apart and cover loosely with a dish towel
  Whole-Wheat-Raisin Scone Variation:  Replace 1 cup all-purpose flour with 1 cup whole-wheat flour, and add 1/2 cup miller's bran to the flour mixture.  Omit nutmeg.

[Instructions.00000000]
  Dissolve yeast in warm water in large bowl.  Stir in milk, sugar, shortening, salt, egg and 2 cups of the flour.  Beat until smooth.  Mix in enough remaining flour to make dough easy to handle.
  Turn dough onto lightly floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic; about 5 minutes.  Place in greased bowl; turn greased side up.  Cover.  Let rise in a warm place until double.  It should be about 80° such as an oven with just the light on.  Dough is ready if an indentation remains when touched.
  Punch down dough.  Shape, let rise again, and bake.
  For cinnamon rolls, after the dough rises for the first time, roll into rectangle with rolling pin.  Sprinkle on brown sugar, chopped nuts, raisins, cinnamon, and melted butter.  Roll up dough the short way and cut into pieces 1" thick.  Place on cookie tray with pieces touching.  Let rise in a warm place.  Cook for 15-25 minutes (depends up thickness of pieces) at 350°.
[Comments.00000000]
  After kneading, dough can be covered and refrigerated in greased bowl no longer than 4 days.  Also can be refrigerated overnight after dough has been shaped before second rising.

  2 Tablespoons butter or margarine
[Instructions.00000000]
  Cook peeled potatoes in boiling water.  Drain.  Mash until smooth.  (I like to put the potatoes through a potato ricer and then use an electric mixer.  This assures no lumps.)  Add cream cheese, sour cream, onion, salt, salt, and white pepper.  Beat until light and fluffy.  Cool.
  Cover and place in refrigerator.  These may be used any time within two weeks.  To use, place desired amount in greased casserole, dot with butter, and bake in preheated 350° oven until heated through, about 30 minutes.  The entire recipe fills a two-quart casserole.
  To microwave, in step 5, put potatoes in microwave safe casserole and probe to 150° using 80% power.

[Instructions.00000000]
  Brew coffee.  Put one level teaspoon of sugar and 1/2 ounce Amaretto in an 11 ounce red wine glass.  Roll mixture around bowl of glass until well-coated.  Light sterno burner and, holding glass by stem, slowly roll over flame in order to evenly heat contents.  Tip rim of glass toward flame until it ignites.  Turn out lights for best effect!  Contents will burn best with glass at 45° angle.  When flame goes out (half of Amaretto will have evaporated), repeat process for additional glasses.  Pour in 1 1/2 ounces of Kahlua and 1 1/2 ounces of Amaretto (or to taste).
  For two drinks, whip 4 ounces of whipping or heavy cream.  For four drinks, whip 8 ounces.  Whip until stiff adding 1/2 to one teaspoon of sugar.
  Pour hot coffee into glasses to within 3/4 inches of rim.  Stir.  Use a teaspoon to float cream on top of drinks.  Use a small bowl with warm water to lubricate spoon between scoops.  Be careful not to touch rim of glass or to overflow glass (It makes a mess if you do).  Sprinkle cinnamon over cream and, using the Kahlua cap, fill and pour one capful of Amaretto over cinnamon.
